# We Don't Need no Stinking Badges!

Is a widely quoted paraphrase of a line of dialogue from the 1948 film The 
Treasure of the Sierra Madre.[1]  That line was in turn derived from dialogue
in the 1927 novel, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which was the basis for 
the film. The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel 
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927):

      "All right," Curtin shouted back. "If you are the police, where 
      are your badges? Let's see them." 
      "Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. 
      In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any 
      stinking badges, you god-damned cabr√≥n and chinga tu madre!"

The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, 
which was altered from its content in the novel to meet the Motion Picture
Production Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film.[3] In one 
scene, a Mexican bandit leader named "Gold Hat"[4] (portrayed by
Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart)[5] 
that he and his company are Federales:

  	Dobbs: "If you're the police, then where are your badges?"
 	Gold Hat: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no 
                  badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"

The point was that without a badge, Dobbs had no way to validate Gold Hat 
was a Federale when in fact he was actually a bandit.

# What Makes a Good Badge

	- Stylish - yes, you too can have one and wear it proudly
	- Informative - name, rank, title
	- Color Coded for Info at a Glance
	- Personalization - unique info about the holder
	- Globally Unique ID - no two badges can be the same
	- Ability to transfer assets digitally via machine vision (e.g. a QR-Code)
	- Ability to revoke access on badge - e.g. de-authorize

The intention of this script is to perform the required data mining on a minimal set of unique labeled 
attributes information to hit the above goals


# Badge Generator

- The motivation for this script was to autogenerate badges for LDRS37
- LDRS37 is a large HPR Event which will happen in 2018 in Helm, CA - in order to facilitate
  registration validation and user access it is desirable to automatically generate Badges
  based on Web form submissions
- We would also like to keep the Database small and with minimal info (e.g. email only) and
  not rely on full database info (e.g. WPUsers information)
- Generates 300 Dpi Badge Images (PNG) for ticketprinting.com based on ldrs37.org web submissions
- Computes DPI for PNG based on input DPI and Ticket Width/Height
  - Note: only Tested with SMALL VIP EVENT BADGE: 4.1" X 2.7 in Portrait mode
- Uses input CSV file of submissions from LDRS37.org
    - Fields of CSV file are:
      [ID,Email, "First Name","Last Name",Organization,"Membership Number","Cert Level",Signature]
- Logic is as follows:
   - Install Graphic logo for event
   - Print out LDRS37 Badge ID
   - Generate QRCode with VCARD Info for Contact (Email and TRA/NAR #, Signature only)
   - Show TRA or NAR badge based on Organization ID
   - Generate FLIER, STAFF, VENDOR based on keywords in Signature
   - Generate UUID from Email Address+ID
   - Generate Digital Signature from Email address and Private signing Key
   - Generate Barcode from ID

# Prerequisites

Install Perl on a Modern Debian distribution, install packages below:

	- cpan Text::CSV
	- cpan Image::Magick
	- cpan Imager::QRCode
	- cpan GD
	- cpan GD::Barcode
        - cpan Data::GUID
	- cpan File::Slurp
	- cpan MIME::Base64
	- cpan Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
	- cpan Digest::SHA

NOTE: cpan -l will list installed packages.

# Operation

- Run as below:
  - ./badges.pl <csvfile>
  - Output will be in the "badges" subdirectory of this folder
  - Resulting PNG files ready for printing
  - Sample file provided with a couple full-featured examples (rm_empties.csv)

# Tweaking output

Once all of the PNG files are in the badges directory and a complete set
has been generated, you can use ImageMagick convert from the command line
to round all of the edges like the below command which can be run in C-Shell
from within the badges directory:

 foreach i (`ls *.png`)
     echo $i
      convert $i \
        \( +clone  -alpha extract \
	-draw 'fill black polygon 0,0 0,15 15,0 fill white circle 15,15 15,0' \
        \( +clone -flip \) -compose Multiply -composite \
        \( +clone -flop \) -compose Multiply -composite \
     \) -alpha off -compose CopyOpacity -composite  $i
 end


	
# Future Directions

  - XML Schema for Layout
  - More layout/print options
  - Link database CSV with more information for QRCode
  - <ore VCARD Fields for QR-Code
  - Trackback link for hits (Scans)
